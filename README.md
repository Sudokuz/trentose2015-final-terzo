# sprint2
The changes in this sprint are minimal. We essentially added new input box in the interface that will allow users to explicitly check the score of a language. With these changes the system should:

1- If no language is given, the application behaves exactly as in Sprint1.
2- If the user inserts the language, then the app should instead visualise the *score* for that language.
